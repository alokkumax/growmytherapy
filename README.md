🌿 Dr. Maya Reynolds — Therapy Website Redesign

This project is a complete redesign of a therapy homepage based on the professional profile of Dr. Maya Reynolds, PsyD.

The goal was to transform the original lilac-themed template into a cohesive, grounded, and professional therapy website aligned with her specialties, tone, and location.

📌 Project Overview

The website was redesigned using Dr. Maya Reynolds’ profile as the single source of truth for:

Specialties (Anxiety, Trauma, Burnout)

Treatment approach (Evidence-based, CBT, trauma-informed)

Client population (Adults)

Location (Santa Monica)

Practice format (In-person and virtual sessions)

All homepage copy, services, FAQs, and supporting sections were rewritten to reflect this information accurately and naturally.

🎨 Design Direction
New Theme & Visual Identity

The original lilac palette was fully replaced with a grounded, coastal-inspired color system:

Primary: Deep Sage Green

Secondary: Warm Sand / Soft Ivory

Accent: Muted Coastal Blue

The goal was to create a tone that feels:

Calm

Professional

Trustworthy

Coastal yet grounded (aligned with Santa Monica)

Typography was updated to reflect a clean, minimal, psychologist-appropriate aesthetic.

All components (text, buttons, sections, images, UI elements) use the new palette consistently.

SEO considerations include:

Location-specific keywords (Santa Monica therapy)

Natural keyword integration in headings and body text

Clear H1 structure for search visibility

Sections rewritten include:

Services (3 core services selected from profile)
